### Plugin Details

This plugin was designed for use on a Spigot Minecraft server, version 1.20.6. 

The latest version of the plugin is v1.1.2, found [here](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/ItWasADream/releases/tag/v1.1.2).

This version has the following features:
- The "dream" feature: upon player death, the player survives and is instantly teleported to their last respawn location with their last saved inventory.
- Works with beds and respawn anchors.
- Handles players joining, quitting, bed destruction, and more.
- Custom resource pack for custom respawn sound. Defaults to vanilla sounds if denied.

### Resource Pack

The resource pack contains data for a royalty-free flashbang sound effect located [here](https://tuna.voicemod.net/sound/5627d887-1b59-4628-8a6e-e99d406c40d3).

It can be downloaded directly and used from the Releases section, at the release title "Resource Pack for this Plugin", [here](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/ItWasADream/releases/tag/rp).
However, downloading the plugin is not necessary for use on a Spigot server, as players joining will be prompted to "automagically" download the resource pack, as it is hosted on the Github release, automatically applying it to the client.
